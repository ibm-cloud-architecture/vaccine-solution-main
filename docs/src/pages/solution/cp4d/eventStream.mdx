Following is the whole architecture on how the user case works: Cloud pak for data will read streaming data from Cloud pak for integration and then build model on the streaming data and deploy it with Watson Machine Learning in Cloud Pak for Data. After the model is deployed, it will have a endpoint to score the new message from Event Stream in Cloud pak for Integration.
