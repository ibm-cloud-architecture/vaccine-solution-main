Recalls that **events** are fact of what happen within the process, and we organize them over a time line running from left to right. Orange stickers represent Events.\n\nWhen doing remote workshop we can use collaborating tool, like Mural. \n\n### Lab exercice\n\n1. Focusing on the delivery part, start by a hot spot is identified and an order to ship vaccine is created in the ordering system.\n1.
