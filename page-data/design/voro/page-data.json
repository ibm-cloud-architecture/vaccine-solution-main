The vaccines at the supplier sites are also becoming available over time following production or replenishment schedule, and vaccine transports are restricted by the reefer container availability. To more effectively model this complex distribution problem, the supply and customer network (Figure 2) needs to be transformed into a time-space network (Figure 3). The distribution optimization problem can then be modeled as a network flow problem. \n\n ![Supplier/Customer Network Topology](./images/voro-fig2.png)\n\n ![3](./images/voro-fig3.png)\n\nEach note in the time-space network represents an entity (supplier or customer) at a certain time, and the arcs represent material flows. There are four types of arcs: \n\n1. Production arcs, for new vaccines to become available at supplier sites\n1. Stay arc, let time progress without moving geographically\n1. Transport arc, for delivery of vaccine with reefer containers\n1. Reposition arc, for repositioning available reefers to supplier locations\nWithin the construction of the time-space network, an order can then ben modeled as an order node. Vaccines flow from customer node to the order node to indicate the fulfillment of orders, and reefer containers may need to be repositioned to support the vaccine transport (Figure 4). An order node may be fulfilled by multiple customer node to indicate a delivery window for the order (Figure 5) \n\n\n ![4](./images/voro-fig4.png)\n\n ![5](./images/voro-fig5.png)\n\n## Vaccine and Reefer Flow Balances\n\nIn the time-space network, vaccines and reefers movements observe flow balances, indicating what goes into a node equal to what comes out of the node. Each node is a transient point thus observing certain balancing property (Figure 6 & Figure 7) \n\n\n ![6](./images/voro-fig6.png)\n\n ![7](./images/voro-fig7.png)\n\n## Model Description\n\nThe optimization model seeks to minimize the logistics costs of vaccines and reefer containers to fulfill the vaccine orders within the delivery windows. The logistics cost may include the shipping costs, both fixed costs per shipment, and variable costs per reefer containers, as well as the storage costs of reefers at the supplier cites and customer sites. The fulfillments are subjected to the availability of both vaccines and reefer containers. The orders may have a different priority levels so that when the resources are limited, the more critical orders will be given priority to fulfill. \nThe problem is formulated as a mixed-integer programming model and solved by IBM CPLEX optimization solver through Watson Machine Learning service. \nAfter optimization, we will process the results to construct the optimized plans for both the vaccines and reefer containers. The vaccine plan will specify which supplier site will provide how much quantity of vaccines for the order to be delivered at what time. The reefer plan is supporting the vaccine plan so that then vaccine moves, there will be enough reefer to transport. \n\n\n## Data Model\n\nTo support the optimization model development we want to define the following data elements:\n\n* Reefer: \n    * Reefer ID: Unique identifier\n    * Capacity: how many vials can the container hold \n    * Status: (ready or in transit or in maintenance) \n    * Location: if in transit status, the transit-to location\n    * Available Date: if in transit status, future availability date\n\n* Order: \n    * Order ID: Unique identifier\n    * Destination: location to be delivered\n    * Priority: higher priority order may displace lower priority order plans\n    * Quantity: # of vials ordered\n    * Requested Delivery Date (RDD): customer requested delivery date for the order.
