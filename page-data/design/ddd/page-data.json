We can see from the second entity diagram that the aggregage is becoming the  **Order fulfillment plan**, so a new service for that makes a lot of sense.\n\n\n### Commands to APIs\n\nFor the order bounded context we have identified a set of commands that can lead to a development of an open APIs specifications. \n\n ![6](./images/ddd-order-commands.png)\n\n### Event Driven?\n\nWell, event storming helps to focus on events.
