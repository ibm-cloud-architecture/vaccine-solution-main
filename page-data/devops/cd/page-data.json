As documented in the [Appsody Docs](https://appsody.dev/docs/using-appsody/building-and-deploying#deploying-your-application-through-docker-hub), we are able to take advantage of the pre-built container images available on Docker Hub and the annotated `app-deploy.yaml` file that is now a synonymous GitOps-like deployment artifact to quickly apply the change to the target namespace in the same cluster. Once the `appsody deploy` command is succesful, the Appsody Operator and Kubernetes takes care of the rest and reconciles the necessary underlying Kubernetes artifacts that are required to fulfill the requirements of serving up the application code in real-time!\n\n![Tekton CD - PipelineRun Logs](images/tekton-pr-logs.png)\n\n### Deploying the simulator microservice with Tekton & Appsody\n\n#### Prerequisites\n\n1. Ensure all necessary Kubernetes ConfigMaps and Secrets have been created in the namespace in which the application will be running.\n2. Ensure an [Appsody Operator](https://appsody.dev/docs/using-appsody/building-and-deploying#deployment-via-the-appsody-operator---overview) has been configured to watch the namespace in which the application will be running.\n3. Create a new or modify an existing Service Account in the target namespace and bind the required API RBAC requirements for the Appsody Operator.\n    * Further details available in the [Appsody Docs](https://appsody.dev/docs/using-appsody/building-and-deploying#rbac-considerations-for-the-use-of-appsody-deploy-and-appsody-operator-commands)\n    * A sample YAML document has been provided via [rbac-sa.yaml](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/refarch-reefer-ml/blob/master/scripts/tekton/rbac-sa.yaml), with environment-specific updates to the Namespace and Service Account name fields being required.\n3. From the `refarch-reefer-ml` directory, import the Tekton pipeline artifacts:\n```shell\nkubectl apply -f scripts/tekton/\n```\n4. Validate these items have been imported successfully by querying the cluster:\n```shell\nkubectl get Pipeline,Task,PipelineResource\n```\n\n#### Using the command-line interface\n\n1. Open the `/scripts/tekton/manual/simulator-pipeline-run.yaml` file in a text editor and ensure everything makes sense.\n2. Kick off a new pipeline run with the Kubernetes CLI:\n```shell\nkubectl create -f scripts/tekton/manual/simulator-pipeline-run.yaml\n```\n3. You can monitor the pipeline by common `kubectl get` and `kubectl describe` commands:\n```shell\nkubectl get PipelineRun\n```\nFor further details on how to access the logs of a PipelineRun, reference the [Tekton Pipelines documentation](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline/blob/v0.9.2/docs/logs.md).\n4. Once the pipeline completes, you should see a deployed instance of the Simulator Appsody application:\n```shell\nkubectl get Pods\n```\n\n#### Using the Tekton dashboard\n\n1. Access the Tekton Pipelines dashboard from your Kabanero installation or directly via the defined Route. This will be something similar to [https://tekton-dashboard-tekton-pipelines.apps.green.ocp.csplab.local](https://tekton-dashboard-tekton-pipelines.apps.green.ocp.csplab.local).\n2. Click **PipelineRuns** in the left-nav menu and click **Create PipelineRun** from the upper-right of the page.\n3. Enter the following parameters and click **Create**:\n    * **Namespace:** Target namespace for application deployment target\n    * **Pipeline:** `appsody-deploy-pipeline`\n    * **PipelineResources > git-source:** `git-source-reefer-ml`\n    * **Params > context:** `simulator`\n    * **Service Account:** `reefer-simulator`\n4. A new PipelineRun will be created. Click on the name of the running PipelineRun.\n5. From here, you can monitor the live running logs of the pipeline, as well as see what is running from the command-line with Kubectl (`kubectl get pods`). Note that the pipeline is actually running in pods deployed to the target namespace!\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"3c319fbf0cd92dff49ef679c19851d51","counter":239,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Continuous Deployment","description":"Continuous"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Continuous Deployment\ndescription: Continuous\n---\n\nOur Continuous Deployment (CD) approach focuses on a GitOps-based deployment model, using Git as a single source of truth for the deployment, management, and operations of our running application components.
