You may find it useful to share this information with your business leaders before engaging them in such innovative projects.\n\nAt a high level, this is what you should expect to learn by working through this and other related repositories:\n\n* **As an architect,** you will understand how the event-driven architecture provides capabilities which support development of event-driven solutions to addess loosely coupling of the microservices and scale horizontally. You will understand how to inject complex stateful operation on data stream for real time processing, understand new modern pipeline to data lake to let scientists develop AI model to be deployed as service.\n* **As a developer,** you will understand how to develop event-driven applications and develop real time analytics based on Kafka streams.
