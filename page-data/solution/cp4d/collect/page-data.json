For that, he uses the `Virtualize` menu \n\n![Data Virtualization menu](./images/virtualize-1.png)\n**Figure 9: Data Virtualization menu**\n\nand then selects Mongo DB in the `Filters` column and may be apply some search on specific database name.\n\n![](./images/virtualization.png)\n**Figure 10: Data Virtualization on Mongo DB**\n\nOnce done, he selects the expected tables and then use `Add to cart` link. It is important to note that we have two tables to match the telemetry json document and the sensors sub json document.\n\nThe next step is to assign them to a project:\n\n![](./images/virtualize-tables.png)\n**Figure 11: Data Virtualization cart and tables**\n\n\n## Create a joined view\n\nWe need to join the telemetries and the sensors data into the same table, to flatten the records. In the current Mongo document, there is a 1 to 1 relationship between telemetry and telemetry sensor, so it is easy to flatten the model in one table.\n\nIn the Data Virtualization, as a data steward, we select `My Virtualized data`, and then \nselect TELEMETRICS and TELEMETRICS_SENSORS tables, then the `Join view`. Within this new panel, we create a join key, by dragging the `TELEMETRICS_ID` and `_ID` together:\n\n![Joining tables](./images/join-tables.png)\n**Figure 12: Joining tables**\n\nOnce joined, a new view is created:\n\n![Joined view](./images/join-view.png)\n**Figure 13: Join view**\n\nWe see, now, those new assets as part of the project (Use `Add to project`). The figure below show this new asset in the project:\n\n![Telemetries asset in the project](./images/telemetries-asset.png)\n**Figure 14: Telemetries asset in the project**\n\nWith some data:\n![Telemetry Data](./images/telemetry-data.png)\n**Figure 15: Telemetry data**\n\nNote: It is important to note that building those views will create new connection to the database engine that can be accessed by using external tool.\n\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"372c271b21e087db8dadebfb5f533ff9","counter":259,"owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx"},"frontmatter":{"title":"IBM Cloud Pak for Data - data collection","description":"IBM Cloud Pak for Data - data collection"},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: IBM Cloud Pak for Data - data collection\ndescription: IBM Cloud Pak for Data - data collection\n---\n\nTo develop the anomaly detection service we first need to access the data.
