We show here a very basic workflow. The workflow can be made as complex as needed with sub-workflow with more manual and system controlled gates as needed by a customer.\n\n__Prerequisites__\n\n1. Ensure you have installed Cloud Pak For Data 3.5 with following components - Watson OpenPages, Watson KNowledge Catalog, Watson Studio, Watson Machine Learning, Watson OpenScale and Db2.\n\n2. You have to ensure that in OpenPages a Model is created with all fields as needed in the following workflows. The list of the fields you can see in the diagram below. You can add these fields by going through Solution Configuration -> Objects -> Model -> Fields -> New Field in OpenPages with 'Enable System Admin Model' set. You should add these fields to MRG-Model grouop. After that add these fields to the Views -> Demo-Task_model.\n\n![1](./images/MDLCModelFields.png)\n\n3. You have to ensure that you have all necessary users created in OpenPages - ModelManager, ModelOwner, ModelDataEngineer, ModelDEveloper, ModelValidator, and ModelDeployer. You can add these users by going through Solution Configuration -> Users and Security -> Users -> Create User.\n\n4. You have to ensure that necessary configuration is done in OpenPages to integrate the same with OpenScale.\n\n\nThe steps in the diagram below would be executed in the rest of the instructions in this section.\n\n ![1](./images/ModelOps-2.png)\n \n \n The Components of Cloud Pak For Data used for this are in the diagram below.\n\n ![1](./images/CoreNerStonesMLOps.png)\n \n \n \n\n__Step 1 : Initiate Model Development Lifecycle__\n\nCPD Component Used - Watson OpenPages, Watson Knowledge Catalog\n\nRole - ModelOwner\n\n1.
