The process of scheduling an engineer and then completing the work can best be facilitated through a process based, structured workflow. We will be using IBM BPM on Cloud or Cloud Pak for Automation to best demonstrate the workflow.\n\nBefore creating a ticket or while adding information to the ticket, the process may get the container estimated arrival time and destination harbor to do the dispatching.

Craft Voyage Payload\n    * Script - This step assembles the payload for communicating to the reefer container microservice for status updates. We will craft it from the incoming payload.\n2. Set Machine To Maintenance\n    * Service Flow - This step creates a REST call to the reefer container to set the machine to Maintenance Mode\n3. Schedule Dispatch\n    * User Interface - This step gives the scheduler team an interface to look at the given maintenance request and reefer container with issues and manually assign a worker to provide physical support on it\n4. Work Order Completion\n    * User Interface - This step allows the worker to complete a simple form marking the request as fixed and updating comments relating to the effort\n5. Was Completed?\n    * Decision Gateway - This decision gateway determines whether to reassign the task to the worker to fill out on a later date (such as equipment not being available), or allows to finish the process\n6. Set Machine Off Maintenance\n    * Service Flow - This step initiates a REST call to process the changes, capacity, and updated information from the previous captured in the Work Order Completion step.\n\n\n## Deploy TWX to BPM on Cloud\n\nThe following simple video shows you how to deploy the exported 'twx' file to BPM on Cloud. \n\n![Deploying a TWX to BPM On Cloud](./images/installTWX.gif)\n\nThe same can be done on Cloud Pak for automation.\n\n## Demo of Workflow\n\nThe following short video presents how to capture our CSRF Token for the Call to Kick off BPM/BAW\n\n![Preparing the Swagger Call](./images/kickoffBPMViaSwagger.gif)\n\n* We get the CSRF Token at first, and then find the Acronym such as via the Designer\n* When we actually execute the request we need the CSRF Token, the Model, the Acronym, and the input data\n\n------------\n\n\n![Forming POST Request](./images/POSTFormationStart.gif)\n\nHere we can see the Model as the Process Name directly from Designer\n\n* Our input data is the input variables in Name,Value pair format\n* We then execute the request and get our 201 Success!\n\n------------\n\nIn this step we open up process portal, claim, and see our Dispatch Scheduler UI.\n\n![Receiving our Dispatch Task Inside Process Portal](./images/scheduleDispatch.gif)\n \n* When we click \"Retrieve Current Location\" we query the container via ID to get updated container info if needed.
