From an existing OpenShift cluster it is possible to [add the IBM Operator Catalog](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSGT7J_20.2/install/install_online_catalog_sources.html) and the IBM Common Services Catalog to your cluster and using OLM to install the IBM operators.

Event Streams is an operator-based release and uses custom resources to define your Event Streams configurations. The Event Streams operator uses the custom resources to deploy and manage the entire lifecycle of your Event Streams instances. Custom resources are presented as YAML configuration documents that define instances of the EventStreams custom resource type. \n\n#### Event Streams\n\nWe strongly recommend to follow [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSza-RwvxSE) to see how easy is to get started with Event Streams v10. \n\nThe installation is in two steps:\n\n* first time deploy the Event Streams operator, which will also automatically deploy the required IBM Cloud Platform Common Services if not present.\n\n ![3](./images/es-operator.png)\n\n* Once operator installed, then create cluster instance, users, topics...\n\n ![4](./images/es-installation.png)\n\nThe installation instructions are in the [product documentation](https://ibm.github.io/event-streams/installing/installing/).\n\n*If you need admin password to access Cloud Pak for Integration console or Event Streams console use the following command:*\n\n ```shell\n oc --namespace ibm-common-services get secret platform-auth-idp-credentials -o jsonpath='{.data.admin_password}' | base64 --decode && echo \"\"\n ```\n\nOnce installation is terminated, install CLI if you want to automate some of the Kafka topic creation, or users creation...
